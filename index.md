### Welcome!

We, the 2018 UFBI fellows are happy to offer an indoor workshop on methods used to address Biodiversity related question in Ecology. The Workshop will be held in the "blabla"  room in the University of Florida Informatics and Biodiversity institute on the 8th and 9th of May. It will be a fun opportunity to gain experience with basic and advanced methods in spatial ecology using different freely available tools and resources, such as R, python, occurrence record databases, and WorldClim. The two-day workshop will take place on May 8th and 9th, and will be divided into four sessions of introductory, hands-on presentations.


### Day 1: Occurrence and Climate data from big databases
1. Acquiring and cleaning occurrence data from online databases
2. Climate data resources and how to extract usable estimates from past climate

### Day 2: Spatial Ecology from Airborne and Satelite data
1. Raster images and estimation of forest cover in R
2. Crown segmentation and species identification with LiDAR and Hiperspectral data
