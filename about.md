“She is interested in integrating zooarchaeological data and paleoclimate reconstructions from the Maya Lowland areas of Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico. Using data and spatiotemporal modeling tools, she investigates how the local and regional biota were affected by direct human exploitation, habitat modification, short-term climate changes such as droughts, and shifts of cultural complexity through time. Her research aims to improve our understanding of the complex interplay between humans, climate, and biodiversity.”

Her research focuses on investigating large-scale factors involved in the mechanism behind  observed patterns of bat diversity. Her study area is Madre de Dios, Peru. She is also interested in developing new automated ways to analyze acoustic data, and preparing educational material  to rural communities.

His research involves the use of big data to explore the relationship between polyploidy and niche adaptation in plants on a global scale. His project involves testing common assumptions about polyploidy in plants while generating new hypotheses and resources for future research.”

His research focuses on predicting changes in forest structure and functionality in a rapidly changing world. He is interested in investigating the ecological processes which determine patterns of plant functional traits within and across  forests in  U.S. He will use a combination of machine learning and process based models, applied to big data in Ecology.
